            <p><h3>Hello!<br> My name is Angelina Savoia.<h4>Welcome to my interactive website.</h4></h3>This site serves as a sort of get to know me. To keep it engaging I decided to make it into a game. Inspired by the popular icebreaker game "Two Truths and a Lie," this version is called "Two Lies and a Truth." Each image will feature a statement, and you need to judge which one is true. Hover over the image that you think is true. <br> Please make sure that this site is viewed on full screen. </p>
