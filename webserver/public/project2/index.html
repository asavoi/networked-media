            <p id="words1"> There was an issue at first, <br>  
                the camera wasn‚Äôt positioned properly. </p>
                
                <p id="words2"> So I walked up the stairs to hide <br> before the performance started. <br> 
                I wasn‚Äôt supposed to get up. </p>
                
                <p id="words3"> My back is to the crowd. <br> 
                The camera only got the back of my head, <br> at most the side of it. <br> 
                But I exist here. </p>
                
                <p id="words4"> In an SD card. <br> 
                I‚Äôll be brought back whenever the video might play. <br> 
                Existing for only a minute. </p>
                
                <p id="words5"> Wasn‚Äôt even a part of the performance. <br> 
                To think that I‚Äôm appearing here unintentionally. </p>
                
                <p id="words6"> When I was little I would see orbs. <br> 
                Just like the white noise in videos. </p>
                
                <p id="words7"> I might always exist on this SD card. <br> 
                I can be downloaded <br> and then forgotten in a folder and buried. <br> 
                Or just deleted. </p>
                
                <p id="words8"> I don‚Äôt know where I‚Äôll end up. </p>

                they think a piece of their soul gets lost. <br> 
                Does this include snapshots of what I remember? </p>

                <p id="words12"> A couple under the bridge outside the window <br> 
                hand in hand <br> 
                head down, head high. <br> 
                a pink and red bucket hat <br> 
                swinging arms. </p>
                
                <p id="words13"> Pelicans flying over graffitied walls, trash <br> and concrete buildings. </p>

                White noise, a blizzard. <br>

                I know the people and the environment. <br> 
                But because I never left I don't have anything for myself. <br> 
                And I‚Äôm at the whim of just being deleted. </p>
